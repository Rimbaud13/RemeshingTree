### Introduction
The goal of this project is to create a remeshing algorithm which would transform
a mesh into a tree/root like structure. The final goal is actually to 3d  print the
resulting mesh and use it as a lamp.

The final report can be found in the `report.pdf` file.

### Results

`final_mesh.obj` contains the final mesh of our project, which is ready to 3d
print.

This first image, shows the original mesh with the resulting mesh supperposed on
it.
